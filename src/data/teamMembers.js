      "Bienvenido! I am Sai, ID in CS and econ, and a member of the class 2022. I started EON with my colleagues with the purpose of making a community that focuses on achieving goals and most importantly, having fun while doing it. I am particularly interested in how technology is being immersed in our cultures, disrupting the way we think and work. Therefore, my hope for EON is to continuously learn and execute our goals as a community that will better prepare us for a more innovative world.",

What means most to me about EON are the stories that come out of the experience. Everyone has their own and they fail to inspire. Catch me reading, playing guitar, jamming to music, playing baseball, or listening to people tell about themselves. Reach out!",

      "Olá! I’m a Neuroscience major, Spanish minor, graduate of class of 2020. The idea of entrepreneurship was something that I didn’t quite understand and, truthfully, scared me; I didn’t think I was creative enough. BUT I soon learned that having an entrepreneurial mindset is simply trying to solve problems from a different perspective! My life changed and it’s never been the same. I’m a lover of languages, a violin player, an amateur artist, and more.",

      "I am a Mechanical Engineering Major Visual Arts Minor who cares about creativity. I am a collaborator, a resource linker, and a critical thinker who doesn’t claim expertise in any one field, but is dedicated to exploring the viability of all options in order to compile the best possible solution to any given problem. I possess eclectic experience and self-taught skills but I believe that if you love an end-product, then others will too.  Creativity is a muscle and Think Tank not only provides me with intense exercise, but also targets new creative muscle groups I didn’t know existed by flooding me with refreshingly different points of view.",

      "Hello! I am a Mathematics major, Economics minor, and member of the Class of 2021. I never really understood entrepreneurship until I went to an EON meeting and then I was hooked. I have had the pleasure to join this group in building our culture of innovation from the start. I help plan the EON Speaker Series which we envision as a way to inspire more students to embrace their creative side and implement meaningful change. In my free time you might find me improving my self-taught guitar skills, crushing it on the racquetball courts, or shredding up the glades on my skis.",

    bio: "Hey all! My name is Emma, last name Lee (not to be confused with Emily). Growing up with a mother who was a ceramic artist I learned the value of creativity at a young age and even though I'm not an artistic in a classical sense have always been inspired to create. As a founding member of EON I wanted to develop an organization which would break down the silos which I think currently ensconce entrepreneurship to help make it accessible to people of all trades, with hopes of empowering others to see their ideas materialize. I truly believe revolutionary change is not possible without collaboration that brings together people from diverse backgrounds and with diverse ways of thinking, so please reach out to me if you have any ideas about how we can make this world a better place.",
